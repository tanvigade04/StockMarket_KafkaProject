# Stock Market Analysis Project using Kafka

## Project Overview:
   This project aims to create a comprehensive data pipeline for stock market analysis using a range of powerful technologies. The main objective is to collect, process, analyze, and visualize stock market data in real-time.
## Technology & Services used:
 + Python: Used for scripting, data manipulation, and integrating different components of the pipeline. 
 + SQL: Employed for querying data and conducting complex analyses to derive meaningful insights.
 + Apache Kafka: Used for real-time data streaming to ensure timely collection and processing of stock market data.
 + AWS Glue: Employed for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
 + AWS Athena: Utilized to perform serverless SQL queries on data stored in S3, enabling quick and efficient insights without complex infrastructure.
 + Amazon S3: Serves as a scalable storage solution for both raw and processed data.
 + AWS QuickSight: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the data in an easy-to-understand manner.
